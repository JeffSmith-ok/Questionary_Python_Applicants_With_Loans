# Second Challenge Project at Columbia Engineering Fintech Program

This is a command line application using python with the fire and questionary libraries to match applicants with the qualifying loans.

Firstly, the application will ask the user to provide the file to the latest banking data.

Secondly, the loan qualification criteria, provided by the user through responses to the questionary questions, involves the following:

- credit score
- loan size
- debit to income ratio (calculated)
- loan to value ratio (calculated)

Thirdly, if there are qualifying loans, the user will be asked to provide a file path to save the file or if there are no qualifying loans, the user wiil be informed and the application will exit.
